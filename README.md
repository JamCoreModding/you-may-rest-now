You May Rest Now modifies the vanilla 'You may not rest now, there are monsters nearby' mechanic to
allow sleeping, assuming that any nearby monsters can not reach you. It it also configurable to
completely disable the mechanic.

## How to Configure

You May Rest Now can be configured via an in-game configuration screen which can be accessed in Mod
Menu (Fabric/Quilt) or the mods screen (Forge/NeoForge).

There are 3 options for the mode:

1. `VANILLA`: use the default vanilla behavior (only able to sleep if no monsters are nearby)
2. `DENY_IF_PATHFINDABLE`: allow sleeping only if nearby monsters cannot reach you.
3. `DISABLE`: always allow sleeping no matter what monsters are nearby.
